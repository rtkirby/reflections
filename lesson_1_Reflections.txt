What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	in google docs it is automatic, you might have too many commits. but if you do it 	manually you might not do one that later would have proved to be important.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	git gives you better flexibility to make those choices. Google docs is set up to save 	auto because it is designed as a document editor.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	Git log will show you the progression of changes. Git diff can show you the changes that 	were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	you can go back and see or retrieve a change and/or previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
